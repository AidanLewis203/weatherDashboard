# weatherDashboard


## Description
This is a project made to test my ability to work with api's. It has helped me strengthen those abilities. The purpose of the page itself is to assist people with planning out their week and adjust accordingly for the weather. This will help people have a less stressful week as they can plan for things they may not have planned for previously.


## Usage
To use this project you enter your desired city in the search bar. Once you have searched for the city the page will load a 5 day forecast of the weather there. You can use this to help you plan out a trip if you are going to that city. Or if you search for the city you live in then you can just use it to better plan out your typical week.
